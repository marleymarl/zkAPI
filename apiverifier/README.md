# zkAPI

Welcome to the zkAPI starter project for creating verified API calls. The basic use case for this is creating an Oracle that runs off provable computation rather than economic incentives. 

An example of this would be a prediction market smart contract on an EVM-based chain like Ethereum or Layer 2's like Arbitrum, Base, Mantle, Optimism or zkSync. 

Prediction markets rely on an off-chain call to determine the outcome of what was predicted (e.g. the results of a political race, a sporting event, temperatures in some locale on some date etc.). 

With a zkAPI a call to an API can be triggered through a smart contract that makes a call to the Risc Zero Bonsai API which in turn returns a result along with a proof that the API call was run correctly and therefore the result can be trusted (in so far as the data provider is trusted, e.g. weatherapi.com)

## Required API key

This requires a Bonsai API key from Risczero.com. 


### Required Smart Contracts

In order for the overall system to work, it requires integration of the contracts in the risc0-foundry-template. 





```

### Running proofs remotely on Bonsai

_Note: The Bonsai proving service is still in early Alpha; an API key is
required for access. [Click here to request access][bonsai access]._

If you have access to the URL and API key to Bonsai you can run your proofs
remotely. To prove in Bonsai mode, invoke `cargo run` with two additional
environment variables:

```bash
BONSAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" BONSAI_API_URL="BONSAI_URL" cargo run
```

## How to create a project based on this template

Search this template for the string `TODO`, and make the necessary changes to
implement the required feature described by the `TODO` comment. Some of these
changes will be complex, and so we have a number of instructional resources to
assist you in learning how to write your own code for the RISC Zero zkVM:

- The [RISC Zero Developer Docs][dev-docs] is a great place to get started.
- Example projects are available in the [examples folder][examples] of
  [`risc0`][risc0-repo] repository.
- Reference documentation is available at [https://docs.rs][docs.rs], including
  [`risc0-zkvm`][risc0-zkvm], [`cargo-risczero`][cargo-risczero],
  [`risc0-build`][risc0-build], and [others][crates].

## Directory Structure

It is possible to organize the files for these components in various ways.
However, in this starter template we use a standard directory structure for zkVM
applications, which we think is a good starting point for your applications.

```text
project_name
├── Cargo.toml
├── host
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   └── src
│       └── main.rs                        <-- [Host code goes here]
└── methods
    ├── Cargo.toml
    ├── build.rs
    ├── guest
    │   ├── Cargo.toml
    │   └── src
    │       └── bin
    │           └── method_name.rs         <-- [Guest code goes here]
    └── src
        └── lib.rs
```
